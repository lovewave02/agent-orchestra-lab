# Agent Orchestra Lab

An experiment platform for multi-agent task orchestration with measurable quality/cost/speed tradeoffs.

## Why this is portfolio-worthy
- Very current topic, but grounded by evaluation metrics.
- Shows prompt design + systems thinking + observability.
- Easy to demo with real workflows.

## MVP scope
- Supervisor routes tasks to specialist agents
- Structured tool-call logs
- Evaluation harness for quality/latency/token-cost

## Tech stack
- Python
- Orchestration: LangGraph-like graph pattern
- Storage: SQLite for run logs
